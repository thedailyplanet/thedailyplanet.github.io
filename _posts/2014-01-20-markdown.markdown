By way of experimentation, we can use this post to familiarise ourselves with the creation of formatted text using *markdown*<sup>[1][1]</sup> syntax.

We have a variety of formatting options, suitable for all manner of occasions in the production of documents. For example, we can do quotes:

> Within the field of research that investigates and theorises about the impact of security 
> technologies, a wealth of research methodologies have been applied which reflects the diverse 
> nature of the individual technologies and the huge disparities in where and how they are implemented 
> and operated. 


(or *not*)

We can have code:

{% highlight applescript %}    tell application "Foo"
        beep
    end tell 
{% endhighlight %}

Tables:

|What|could|go|wrong|
|----|----|----|----|
|almost|anything|can|happen!|
|but|most|likely|nowt :)|


Lists:

* apples
* bananas
* pears


1. potatoes
2. carrots
3. cabbages
