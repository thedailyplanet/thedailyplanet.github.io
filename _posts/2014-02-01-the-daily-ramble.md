## The daily ramble
k, so a new day beckons.. time for the daily ramble. Fucking weather is pissing me off! Windy, cold, occasionally wet.. **grim**. Fuck this, I want sunshine and at least a little warmth! A lot would be welcome, but I'm not too demanding.. just a decent amount, fairly distributed through the day would be just great.

In other news.. it's late, I'm tiring out and about ready to flop in front of another episode of [Twin Peaks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/?ref_=nv_sr_1). It'd been nearly twenty years since I watched it first (and last) time.. it's been a revelation! Although it seems dated.. 4:3 video format doesn't help, and somewhat _vintage_ fashions (oh boy.. the 80s hangover!), it casts a spell as powerful as the first time.
