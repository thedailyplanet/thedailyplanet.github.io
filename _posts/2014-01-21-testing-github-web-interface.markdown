Another in an ongoing series of test posts... via the github web interface! w00t! No git client required.. 

First impressions are mostly positive, aside from appalling latency on my uplink.. I have a rather simple text editor, for simple text. Neat. What could go wrong?! Perhaps we turn, as ever, to xkcd for some wisdom..

Nah.. it'll be fine!
