<h2 id="the_daily_ramble">The daily ramble</h2>

<p>k, so a new day beckons.. time for the daily ramble. Fucking weather is pissing me off! Windy, cold, occasionally wet.. <strong>grim</strong>. Fuck this, I want sunshine and at least a little warmth! A lot would be welcome, but I’m not too demanding.. just a decent amount, fairly distributed through the day would be just great.</p>

<p>In other news.. it’s late, I’m tiring out and about ready to flop in front of another episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Twin Peaks</a>. It’d been nearly twenty years since I watched it first (and last) time.. it’s been a revelation! Although it seems dated.. 4:3 video format doesn’t help, and somewhat <em>vintage</em> fashions (oh boy.. the 80s hangover!), it casts a spell as powerful as the first time. :)</p>
