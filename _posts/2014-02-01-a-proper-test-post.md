## A proper test post

So, we've done manymany test posts.. none with any *real* test of the prose UI. We _could_ try it a little harder by actually adding some more realistic content.

So, thanks to [prose.io][http://prose.io], [Jekyll][http://jekyllrb.com/], and [GitHub][https://www.github.com] we have a simple blogging engine! A nice, easy user interface and a free shared platform with all the features we need. :)
