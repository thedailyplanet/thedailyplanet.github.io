This is another test post, created from Windows. Point being, we'd like to get a handle on how usable git is in this environment. 

Firstly we open [github][wingit] and sync the repo.
![Github for windows](http://linuxundich.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/github_windows.png)

Then select `tools and options` and choose `open in explorer`. Browse to `_posts` directory. To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.
